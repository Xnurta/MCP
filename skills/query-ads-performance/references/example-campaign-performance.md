# Top-N Campaign Performance

Top 10 campaigns by spend over a 30-day window, enabled campaigns only, with campaign name/type broken out.

  "factEntity": "campaign",

}
```

Notes:
- `pageSize: 10` directly limits to the top 10 — no need to fetch 100 rows and slice client-side.
- `campaign.campaignState_` uses the `entity.field_` convention (this tool, not `get_entity_metadata`).
- `ACOS` in the response is pre-scaled ×100 (Tier 1 confirmed) — append `%` when presenting it, e.g. "17.61%".
