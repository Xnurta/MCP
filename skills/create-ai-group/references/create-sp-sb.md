# Create SP/SB managed group - `save_sp_sb_ai_managed_group` (create mode)

Creates a **Sponsored Products** or **Sponsored Brands** AI managed group. All
arguments go inside a single `request` object. **Create mode is triggered by leaving
`aiGroupId` empty (omit it or set `0`)** - a positive `aiGroupId` means edit, which
belongs to the `edit-ai-group` skill.

Create mode is **AI mode only**. Use `aiActionSettings.xxxStatus` for the action-space
on/off switch. When that action space has a corresponding `aiAutomation` mode field,
set it to `0` (AI); never set it to `1` (Rule/RBA). Rule condition/action configs and
template-based creation are not supported through this tool.

## Required for create

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `profileId` | long | Shop ID |
| `aiGroupName` | string | Unique per profile |
| `acos` | number | Target ACOS on the **x100 scale** - the user's `25%` is sent as **`25`** (not `0.25`). Must be `> 0` |
| `targetType` | int | `1`=drive growth, `2`=maintain stability, `3`=volume, `4`=legacy growth |
| `aiStatus` | int | `0`=off, `1`=on |
| `campaignType` | string | `"sponsoredProducts"` or `"sponsoredBrands"` |

## Common optional fields

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `campaignIds` | int[] | Campaigns to include (auto-increment IDs). Omit to create an empty group |
| `campaignNameSign` | int | Campaign-name label: `0`=off, `1`=on |
| `aiPersonality` | int | `1`-`5`; **must be >=3 when `targetType=3` (volume/冲量)** (front-end rule - MCP won't enforce it) |
| `preAddCampaignNums` | int | Pre-add campaign count |
| `aiAutomation` | object | AI/Rule mode fields: create may use only `0`=AI; never `1`=Rule/RBA. See field-reference |
| `aiActionSettings` | object | Supported action-space config (bid / struct / budget / target optimization). See field-reference |

Only send `aiAutomation` / `aiActionSettings` fields the user wants to change from
platform defaults - both are large flattened objects and you rarely need most of it
for a basic create. Exact field names are in `field-reference.md`.

## Action-space coupling rules

Enabling an action-space switch usually requires sending its companion fields (dynamic
budget -> numType+num; ranges -> min/max with min <= max). Word-list settings are not
supported and must not be sent. The supported coupling rules are in the shared
[`coupling-rules.md`](coupling-rules.md) - read it before enabling any `aiActionSettings`
switch.

## SP vs SB differences (SB is not SP)

Some capabilities exist only for SP. If the group is SB, do **not** send these -
per the 2026-08-14 backend spec they should be rejected, but today they may instead be
silently ignored (looks successful, does nothing):

- `aiActionSettings.structPauseProductStatus` / `structPauseCampaignStatus`
  (struct optimization) - **SP only**
- `aiActionSettings.targetPausedAddStatus` - **SP only**

When the user is on SB and asks for one of these, tell them it isn't available for
Sponsored Brands rather than sending it quietly. The full "which capability is
supported (AI / Rule / none) per SP / SB / SD" matrix is in
[`action-space-matrix.md`](action-space-matrix.md) - check it before enabling any
action-space switch (notably: **SB's BidDaypart has no AI mode**, and
`budgetRedistribute` / `bidAmazonBusiness` are `noRule` - never attach Rule configs).

## Example - create a basic SP group, AI off

```json
{
  "request": {
    "profileId": 3721212165742,
    "aiGroupName": "SP-Core-Keywords-US",
    "campaignType": "sponsoredProducts",
    "acos": 25,
    "targetType": 1,
    "aiStatus": 0,
    "campaignIds": [45444534]
  }
}
```

`campaignIds` uses each campaign's internal `campaignId` (int) - **not**
`amazonCampaignId` (the long Amazon string).

Success returns `data.result.aiGroupId`. Then verify with the full-signature read
`get_entity_metadata(profileIds=[3721212165742], entity='aiGroup',
filters={"aiGroupName": {"like": "%SP-Core-Keywords-US%"}}, userContext='verify created group')`
and exact-match the name in the results (the filter is a substring `like`).

> Reminder: a group created with `aiStatus=0` reads back as `aiStatus=2`
> ("AI Turned Off") - that's expected, it is off.
